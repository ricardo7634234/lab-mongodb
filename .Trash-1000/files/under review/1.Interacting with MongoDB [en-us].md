# Interacting with shell

Use the command bellow in a terminal instance in order to connect to the server via shell:

```bash
mongo

```

Within the MongoDB shell:

## Listing databases:

```bash
show dbs

```

## "Creating" a database:

MongoDB does not provide commands to create a database. You can use `use <database_name>` statement to select a database in the mongo shell. Use the following example:

```bash
use thedatasociety_test_db

```

Check the current db by typing:

```bash
db

```

## Creating a collection

MongoDB stores documents in collections. The collections are analogous to tables in relational databases like MySQL. Generally, you donâ€™t need to create a collection, MongoDB does this automatically during insertion of the first document. For clarification, we will explictily create a collection:

```bash
db.createCollection("myfirstcollection")
```

MongoDB database names cannot be empty. So, lets insert somedata:

```bash
db.myfirstcollection.insert({ id: 1 })
```
Now lets list the dbs again:

```bash
show dbs

```

## Listing collections



```bash
show collections
```



## Renaming collections



```bash
db.myfirstcollection.renameCollection("renamedcollection")
```

```bash
show collections
```



## Droping a collection



```bash
show collections
```

```bash
db.getCollection("renamedcollection").drop();
```

```bash
show collections
```
